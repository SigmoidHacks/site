# We are on a mission.
"Machine Learning Doesn't Have to be Just Another Buzz Word, Make it Real with Sigmoid Hacks!"

Sigmoid Hacks is a free 3-day International virtual event for high school and college students. Come to acquire skills in the field of machine learning and its various applications through a series of workshops and seminars featuring guest speakers. Participants may work by themselves or in groups of up to 3 members. It is an opportunity for everyone to learn new skills, ask questions, get guidance from mentors, participate in fun mini-challenges, and win amazing prizes! Sigmoid Hacks is a student-led hackathon from Hack Club


Our mission is to divert machine learning from it's current "buzzword" state into reality.

# Coding is a superpower.

Starting to code has a lasting impact. Once you begin coding, you switch from being a consumer to being a creator. We want to make everyone a creator—it’s a magical transformation. You can solve problems your way, bounded only by your imagination.

We know this because we’re the leaders of the [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) at Ad Astra School, where we have good infrastructure for students to learn to code. Now, we want to bring that experience to everyone. This is a hackathon by the students, for the students, and for the future of all of Los Angeles.
